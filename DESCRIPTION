Description: ICITools is an implementation of the method for computation of a 
    Specificity Score table given cell-type specific gene expression data. 
    ICItools also contains functions that implement the computaiton of the Index 
    of Cell Identity to identify the most likely cell type of a gene expression 
    profile. The two computationally intensive steps implemented by this package 
    (compute_spec_table and compute_ici_scores) are compatible with the 
    furrr::future_map function, enabling parallelization for multicore machines. 
    The methods in this package were originally developed and described by 
    Efroni, et al. (2016).
